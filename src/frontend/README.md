## Adding components

You can add more reusable components using the CLI:

```bash
npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add [...components]
```

> e.g. `npx react-native-reusables/cli@latest add input textarea`

If you don't specify any component names, you'll be prompted to select which components to add interactively. Use the `--all` flag to install all available components at once.
